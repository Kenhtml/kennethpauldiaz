<p>Introduction</p>
<p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using markup language. HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages. Markup language is used to define the text document within tag which defines the structure of web pages. This language is used to annotate (make notes for the computer) text so that a machine can understand it and manipulate text accordingly. Most of markup (e.g. HTML) languages are human readable. Language uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the text.</p>

<h3 align="center">HTML - TEXT AND TEXT FORMATTING</h3>
<h3><b><u>HTML - TEXT</u></b></h3>

<p>Text is the backbone of any webpage. It plays an double role; t provides content for web surfers to enjoy as they skim through articles of information, but it also gives Search Engines and Spiders keywords and meta data. It is because of the text on pages that we have a network of seemingly endless information available at our fingers.</p>

<h3><b><u>HTML - Paragraph Text</u></b></h3>

<p>Any text containing more than a few lines (or sometimes even more) should exist inside of a paragraph tag "<p>". This tag is reserved specifically for blocks of text, such as those you would expect to find inside your favorite novel.</p>
